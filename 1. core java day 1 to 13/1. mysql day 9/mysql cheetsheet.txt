Java			vs 		SQL
------------------------------------


SQL with mysql
==============
	=> creating database and table
	=> CURD operations
	=> basic SQL quaries Keywords: select, from,where, groupby, having



SQL Quaries:	DML, DDL, Control quaries

MySQL command 
------------------
creating database:		CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS Employee;

shows all databases:		show databases;


listing all tables in database:	SHOW TABLES;

creating tables
-------------------

create table emp
(
    eid int not null auto_increment primary key,
    ename varchar(20) not null,
    city varchar(15),
    designation varchar(20),	
    salary int
);



select 
from 
where 

group by 
having




CRUD operation
==============

CRUD:
-------
use rajdb;


ALTER TABLE:		
			ALTER TABLE Emp RENAME TO employe;

			ALTER TABLE Emp ADD Age numeric(3);

			ALTER TABLE Emp MODIFY Ename VARCHAR(22) NOT NULL;

			ALTER TABLE Emp DROP COLUMN Age;

			

		ALTER TABLE emp CHANGE designation desi VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL;



Drop the table:		DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employee;


changing the column name:

	alter table nameOfthetable change oldColumnName newColumnName varchar (10) ;

	

CURD Operations:
-----------------


INSERT Statement
----------------
	INSERT INTO emp(ename,city,designation,salary) VALUES('Raj','delhi','trainer',20000);


UPDATE Statement
----------------------
	UPDATE emp SET Salary = Salary*1.03 WHERE Perks > 800;


DELETE Statement
------------------
	DELETE FROM Emp WHERE Salary<10000;



REPLACE Statement vs insert
-----------------------------
	REPLACE Statement works exactly same as the INSERT Statement, 
	except only then if an old record in the table has the same 
	value as in new row for a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE index then old 
	row is deleted and new row is inserted. 

	REPLACE INTO Emp VALUES(6,'Amar','Chennai','Developer',16000,1124);


TRUNCATE Statement 
--------------------
	TRUNCATE Statement is also used to empty 
	the table completely. 

	TRUNCATE Emp1;




basic quaries with SQL
====================
SELECT 
FROM
WHERE

GROUP BY
HAVING
ORDER BY
LIMIT



SELECT * FROM Emp;



SELECT Eid, Ename, Salary FROM Emp;

where clause operators
-----------------------
 =
<> or !=
<
< = 
> 
> = 
Like 
Between 
IN 
NOT IN 


> SELECT * FROM Emp WHERE Ename LIKE 'C______';


SELECT * FROM Emp WHERE Salary BETWEEN 8000 AND 10000;

SELECT * FROM Emp WHERE Designation IN ('Manager','Designer');

SELECT * FROM Emp WHERE Designation NOT IN ('Manager','Designer');



Group by
-------------
SELECT * FROM Emp GROUP BY Ename;


constraints
------------
Unique
PK
FK
Check constraints: mySql do not support it directly...we have to write trigger fro it   :(




creating master table and child table relationship
==================================================


engine=InnoDB?


mysql is a very flexibale (oracle=> community , lic)


create table dept
(
	did int not null auto_increment,
	dname char(10)not null,
	primary key(did)
)engine=InnoDB;

create table employee
(
        eid int not null auto_increment,
	ename char(10) not null,
	did int not null,
	primary key(eid),
	foreign key(did) references 
		dept(did) 
	on delete cascade on update 
		cascade
)engine=InnoDB;










Aggregate Function
--------------------
=>	AVG( );
=>	COUNT( );
=>	MAX( );
=>	MIN( );
=>	SUM( );




The HAVING Clause
-----------------------
SELECT * 
FROM Emp 
GROUP BY Salary 
HAVING AVG(Perks)>900;



The ORDER BY Clause
===========================
     
The ORDER BY clause can be used to set 
the order of the retrieved records. 



SELECT * FROM Emp ORDER BY Eid DESC;



The LIMIT Clause
==========================
The LIMIT clause can be used to limit 
the number of records that have been returned 
by the SELECT statement. 

You can specify the start row, and number of records retrieved. 


SELECT * FROM Emp LIMIT 0,2;




Joins
=====================
Types of Joins :
----------------
=> Cross join, cartesian product

=> Inner join/EQ join/ natural join

=> non eq join

=> outer join

=> self join


consider two tables
===================
		1	  N
	Dept --------<>-----------Emp

	pk from 1 side should be put as fk to N side


create table dept
(
	did int not null auto_increment,
	dname char(10)not null,
	primary key(did)
)engine=InnoDB;

create table employee
(
        eid int not null auto_increment,
	ename char(10) not null,
	did int not null,
	primary key(eid),
	foreign key(did) references dept(did) 
	on delete cascade on update cascade
)engine=InnoDB;




INNER Joins/Equi joins
===========
default Join type based on equality .......


SELECT * FROM dept d
     INNER JOIN employee e
     ON d.did=e.did_fk;


	or
	======

select * from client, purchage
where client.c_id=purchage.c_id;




OUTER Joins 
===========
very useful to find database inconsistancies

an OUTER Join returns the all rows that returned by an INNER Join plus all 
the rows from one table that 
did not match any row from the other table. 




Outer Join are divided in two types : 
========================================

LEFT OUTER Join
RIGHT OUTER Join 

LEFT OUTER Join 
=======================
to return all the rows that returned by an 
INNER Join plus all the rows from first 
table that did not match with any row from the 
second table but with the NULL values for each column
 from second table


SELECT * FROM dept
LEFT OUTER JOIN employee
ON dept.did=emp.did_fk;

	

RIGHT OUTER Join
========================

SELECT * FROM dept
RIGHT OUTER JOIN employee
ON dept.did=emp.did_fk;

sm(id, name, city)
.....
....
select 
from sm sm1, sm sm2
where sm1.city=sm2.city and sm1.id<>sm2.id



	
https://www.google.com/search?q=self+join+vs+theta+join&oq=self+join+vs+theta+join&aqs=chrome..69i57j33.8001j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

SELF Join and theta joins are not same!
====================================

joining an table with itself
very useful for non equality condition

Ex: find student who is enrolled in atleast two courses
--------------------------------------------------------
study table
sid 	cid		since
-----------------------------
S1      C1		2019
S2      C2		2018
S1	C2		2020


select 
from study as t1, study as t1
where t1.sid=t2.sid and t1.cid<>t2.cid


inner/nested quaries
correlated quaries


Q1
 operator
	(Q2)



IN/ NOT IN/ Exists
==================
	Consider 
		emp(eid,ename, address)
		project(eid, pid, pname, location)

	eid	 ename	 addess
	1	ravi	chennai
	2	varun	delhi

	Q. find the details of emp whose address is not delhi, chennai or banglore
	Q. find the name of emp whose woring on an project?
	Q. find the details of emp working on at least one project




	=> find the details of emp whose address is delhi, chennai or banglore
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	select *
	from emp
	where address in ('delhi','chennai','banglore');

	=> find the details of emp whose address is not delhi, chennai or banglore
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	select *
	from emp
	where address not in ('delhi','chennai','banglore');


	=> find the name of emp whose woring on an project?
	-------------------------------------------------------
	select ename 
	from emp
	where eid in(select distinct (eid) from project);

	=> find the details of emp working on at least one project
	---------------------------------------------------------
	select * 
	from emp
	where eid exists( select eid
			  from project
			  where emp.eid=project.eid);







Example for max/min nested quaries
=====================================

Find highest salary
--------------------

finding second highest salary
----------------------------

 in Q2

select max(salary) 
from emp 
where salary not in
	(select max(salary) from emp);





find nth higherst salary
-----------------------
select id, salary 
from emp1 e1 where n-1=
	(select count(distinct salary)
	from emp1 e2 
	where e2.salary> e1.salary);


select id, salary 
from emp1 e1 where 2=
	(select count(distinct salary)
	from emp1 e2 
	where e2.salary> e1.salary);



https://www.java67.com/2015/01/second-highest-salary-in-mysql-and-sql-server.html




select name from emp5 where salary =
(select max(salary)
   from emp5 where salary <
	(select max(salary) from emp5));








Find the name of emp getting max salary
------------------------------------
select name
from employee
where salary=(
 select max(salary)
 from employee
 )


find the name of emp second highest salary
-----------------------
select name from employee
where salary=(
	select max(salary)
	from employee
	where salary<>(
 			select max(salary)
 			from employee
 		)
	);

Write a query to display all dept name along with no of emp working in each department
Ex:

eid	ename		dept	salary
1	raj		it	50
2	ekta		sales	60
4	kapil		it	30
5	keshav		mkt	60
6	gunika		fin	50


OP:
it	2
sales	1
mkt	1
fin	1

Q. Write a query to display all dept names where no of employee are less then 2
	select dept 
	from emp
	group by dept
	having count(*)<2;

Q.Write a query to display name of all employee who are working in dept 
	where no of employee are less then 2

	select ename
	from emp
	where dept in (
		select dept 
		from emp
		group by dept
		having count(*)<2;
	);





Join vs Nested quaries vs Correlated Quaries
============================================

Find details of all dept where any employee works

Joins:
------
select distinct dept1.did, dept1.dname 
from dept1, employee1 
where dept1.did=employee1


Nested quaries
--------------
select * from dept1 
where did in (select did_fk from employee1);


Correlated quaries
-----------------
select * from dept1 
where exists (
	select did_fk from 
	employee1 
	where dept1.did=employee1.did_fk);

Correlated quaries
-----------------
select * from emp
where exist(
	select eid
	 from dept 
	where emp.eid=dept.eid);






views
=====

VIEW is a virtual table, which acts like a table but actually it contains no data. 

for abstraction and security

we want to create an view to see only those client records that are active in 
purchage table 



CREATE VIEW
================
CREATE VIEW Supp_Client AS
    SELECT * FROM Client
    WHERE C_ID IN (
    SELECT C_ID FROM purchage)



ALTER VIEW 
==============
ALTER VIEW Supp_Client AS
    SELECT Client.C_ID, Client.Name, Client.City,
    Products.Prod_Detail from Client, purchage
    WHERE Client.C_ID=purchage.C_ID;

now 
========
SELECT * FROM Supp_Client WHERE City='Delhi';



DROP VIEW Statement
====================
DROP VIEW Supp_Client;





Stored Procedures
=================


Stored Procedures and Functions 
================================

Stored Procedures
==================
Stored Procedure is a set of statements, 
which allow ease and flexibility for a programmer 
because stored procedure is easy to execute than reissuing the number of 
individual SQL statements. 


Stored procedure can call another stored procedure also. 


Stored Procedure can very useful where multiple 
client applications are written in different 
languages or it can be work on different 
platforms but they need to perform the same database operations.


Store procedure can improve the performance because 
by using the stored procedure less information needs 
to be sent between the server and the client. 


It increase the load on the database server because 
less work is done on the client side 
and much work is done on the server side.


CREATE PROCEDURE Syntax
===================================================
The general syntax of Creating a Stored Procedure is :

        CREATE PROCEDURE proc_name ([proc_parameter[......]]) routine_body


proc_name : procedure name

proc_parameter : [ IN | OUT | INOUT ] param_name type

routine_body : Valid SQL procedure statement


An IN parameter
==============
 is used to pass the value into a procedure. 

The procedure can be change the value but 
when the procedure return the value then modification 
is not visible to the caller. 


An OUT parameter 
=================
is used to pass the value from the procedure
 to the caller but its visible to the caller. 



An INOUT parameter 
===================
is initialized by the caller and 
it can be modified by the procedure, 
and any change made by the procedure 
is visible to the caller.



simple stored procedure
========================

SP: collection of correlated SQL statement , that we want to 
fire in one go!

	slection ...;
	select ....;
	

delimiter //
	CREATE PROCEDURE Sproc(OUT p1 INT)
  	SELECT COUNT(*) INTO p1 FROM Emp;
    //





bringing back delimiter to ;
=============================
delimiter ;

calling SP
================

CALL Sproc(@a);


printing Output
================
select @a;


Another example:

DELIMITER //


CREATE PROCEDURE Test(IN num1 INT, IN num2 INT ,OUT param1 INT)
BEGIN
set param1 := num1 + num2;
END 
// 

DELIMITER ; 



functions
===============
must return an values

CREATE FUNCTION Syntax
==========================================
The general syntax of Creating a Function is :
        CREATE FUNCTION func_name ([func_parameter[,...]]) RETURNS type routine_body 


func_name : Function name

func_parameter : param_name type

type : Any valid MySQL datatype

routine_body : Valid SQL procedure statement



The RETURN clause is mandatory for FUNCTION. 
It used to indicate the return type of function.



Example:
================

CREATE FUNCTION func(str CHAR(20)) RETURNS CHAR(50)
RETURN CONCAT('WELCOME TO, ',str,'!');


calling function
=================
SELECT func('HCl training session');


try yourself
=================
ALTER PROCEDURE and ALTER FUNCTION Syntax
DROP PROCEDURE and DROP FUNCTION Syntax









CALL Statement Syntax
=======================
The CALL statement is used to call a procedure, 
which has been defined previously. 



CALL can return the values to its caller 
through its parameters that are declared 
as OUT or INOUT parameters. 



This statement is also used to returns 
the number of rows affected that a client program 
can obtain at the SQL level by calling the ROW_COUNT(). 


The general syntax of CALL Statement is :


        CALL p_name([parameter[,...]])



Example
=============
delimiter //
	CREATE PROCEDURE Sp1(OUT p VARCHAR(20),OUT p1 VARCHAR(20),IN p2 INT)
        SELECT Ename,City INTO p,p1 FROM Emp WHERE Eid=p2;
     //




bring delimiter back
========================
delimiter ;




calling sp
=============
CALL Sp1(@Name,@City,1);


display the result
=====================
SELECT @Name,@City;











BEGIN.....END Compound Statement Syntax
========================================
delimiter //

	CREATE PROCEDURE Proc(OUT p VARCHAR(20), OUT p1 VARCHAR(20),IN p2 INT)

	BEGIN
	INSERT INTO Emp VALUES(p2,'Suman','Pune','Web Designer',20000,965);
	SELECT Ename,City INTO p,p1 FROM Emp WHERE Eid=p2;
	END
	
	//




delimiter ;



CALL Proc(@Name,@City,8);



SELECT @Name,@City;















using DECLARE ,SET,SELECT......INTO Statement Syntax
===================================================

EXAMPLE
=============

delimiter //
CREATE PROCEDURE Sproced(OUT p VARCHAR(20),OUT p1 VARCHAR(20),IN p2 INT)
BEGIN
	DECLARE a VARCHAR(20);
	DECLARE b INT;
	SET b=p2;
	SET a='Dev%';
	SELECT * FROM Emp WHERE Designation LIKE a;
	SELECT Ename,City INTO p,p1 FROM Emp WHERE Eid=b;
END
//




delimiter ;
CALL Sproced(@Name,@City,5);


SELECT @Name,@City;











Conditions and Handlers
========================
sort of exception handling........


Some conditions needs specific 
handling and these conditions can 
be related to errors or may be general flow control 
inside a routine. 

Handlers are the methods of handling conditions 
that need to be dealt with. 




Before describing conditions 
and handlers lets try to produce some errors. 

INSERT INTO Emp VALUES(1,'AAA','Delhi','Manager',20000,583);

ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry '1' for key 1
      ===  ========


1062 :error no (different for differnt errors)

23000:SQLSTATE that can be the same for a number of errors. 


If these errors occur in our functions and procedures 
then they will terminate out programs. 

To deal with these conditions we have to create a handler.
			=================================== 


The general syntax of Handler is as follows:

        DECLARE handler_type HANDLER FOR condition_value[,...] statement

handler_type 
========
	can be of the following like CONTINUE, EXIT or UNDO. 

	 CONTINUE
	========
	 the the program will carry on the process after the handler has been called. 

	EXIT
	====
	 then the program will end immediately. 

	The UNDO 
	=======
	is used on transactional tables to rollback work carried out up to that point. 

	HANDLER FOR
	===========
	 tells the compiler, we are declaring a handler. 

	Condition_value 
	================
	is used so that the handler fires when a define conditions met. 

	The statement 
	=============
	is section of code that we want to execute when the handler is fired.  



Example without error handling
==================================

delimiter //
	CREATE PROCEDURE hproc(OUT p VARCHAR(30))
	BEGIN
		INSERT INTO Emp VALUES(1,'aaa','Delhi','Manager',20000,535);
		SET p='Can not Insert';
	END
//




















now
=========

delimiter ;
CALL hproc(@b);


ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry '1' for key 1
=========================================================


SELECT @b;


-----------------------------
nothing was displayed why?
----------------------------




with error handling
=======================

delimiter //

	CREATE PROCEDURE hproc(OUT p VARCHAR(35))
	BEGIN
	
	DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE '23000' SET @b=' With Errors';

	INSERT INTO Emp VALUES(1,'AAA','Delhi','Manager',20000,698);
	
	SET p=CONCAT('Can not Insert ',@b);

	END
	//


delimiter ;
CALL hproc(@c);


mysql> SELECT @c;

Writing Subqueries/Nested quaries
====================================
type of Subqueries

Predicate Subqueries
=====================
 - extended logical constructs in the WHERE (and HAVING) clause.


Scalar Subqueries
===================
 - standalone queries that return a single value; 
they can be used anywhere a scalar value is used.


Table Subqueries
=================
 - queries nested in the FROM clause





consider tables
==================

Predicate Subqueries
=====================
 - extended logical constructs in the WHERE (and HAVING) clause.

Predicate Subqueries can be used in the HAVING and WHERE clause only 
because both are special logical construct.

 These subqueries must retrieve one column.


	IN Subquery
	----------
		list of clients that are available in purchage table also
		ie client that have purchaged also......



		SELECT * FROM Client 
		WHERE C_ID IN(SELECT C_ID FROM Purchage);



		SELECT * FROM Client 
		WHERE C_ID NOT IN(SELECT C_ID FROM Purchage);


	Quantified Subqueries
	---------------------
	        Value_1 {=|>|<|>=|<=|<>} {ANY | ALL | SOME} (query_1)

 

	Exists Subqueries
	-------------------

	The EXISTS subquery is used to tests whether a subquery 
	returns at least one row or a qualifying row exists. 


	also called correlated quaries
		---------------------
	
	ex:
	
	SELECT * FROM Client
   	WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Purchage WHERE Client.C_ID=Purchage.C_ID);



Scalar Subqueries
=================
	The Scalar Subquery is a subquery which returns a single value. 

	A Scalar subquery can be used almost anywhere a single column value can be used. 

	The subquery have to reference only one column in the select list. 


	It must not retrieve more than one row. 


	When subquery retrieve one row then the value of select list column becomes the value of the 	Scalar Subquery. Example : 



	Ex:
		SELECT (SELECT Name FROM Client WHERE C_ID=1);



		SELECT (SELECT C_ID FROM Purchage WHERE C_ID=2) FROM Client;
		------------------------------------------------------------
			this quary may not work
			as return more then one values









Flow Control Constructs
=====================


if
========

delimiter //
CREATE PROCEDURE IFProc(IN p INT)
	IF(p<7)
		THEN
	SELECT * FROM Client;
		ELSE
	SELECT * FROM Purchage;
	END IF
//

delimiter;

CALL IFProc(5);



CASE Statement
==============


CREATE PROCEDURE WHENProc(IN p INT)
    CASE p*10
   WHEN 20 THEN SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price<=7000;
   WHEN 30 THEN SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price>=7000;
   ELSE
   SELECT * FROM Products;
   END CASE
   //



LOOP Statement
=================
        [begin_label:] LOOP statement_list END LOOP [end_label]

	LEAVE Statement :aka break of c programming........




CREATE PROCEDURE LProc()
   BEGIN
    DECLARE p INT;
    SET p=1;
    lbl: LOOP
    SELECT * FROM Client WHERE C_ID=p;
    SET p=p+1;
    IF p > 5
    THEN LEAVE lbl;
    END IF;
    END LOOP;
    END
    //

-----------------
try yourself:

ITERATE Statement
REPEAT Statement
----------------------





WHILE Statement
================

CREATE PROCEDURE WHILProc()

    BEGIN
    DECLARE p INT;
    SET p=1;
    WHILE p <= 5 DO
    
    UPDATE Products
    SET Price=Price*1.03 WHERE C_ID=p;
    SET p=p+1;
    
    IF p=4
    THEN
    SET p=p+1;
     END IF;
    END WHILE;
    SELECT * FROM Products;
    END
    //
























Cursors
=============


Cursors are used when the SQL Select statement is 
expected to return more than one row. 



Cursors are only supported inside procedures and functions. 



Cursors must be declared and its definition contains the query. 


The cursor must be defined in the DECLARE section of the program.


A cursor must be opened before processing and close after processing.


















Syntax to declare the cursor :
-----------------------------
        DECLARE <cursor_name> CURSOR FOR <select_statement>





Multiple cursors can be declared in the procedures and functions 
but each cursor must have a unique name. 

And in defining the cursor the select_statement cannot have INTO clause.















Syntax to open the cursor :
---------------------------------
        OPEN <cursor_name>

By this statement we can open the previously declared cursor.







Syntax to store data in the cursor :
---------------------------------------
        FETCH <cursor_name> INTO <var1>,<var2>

	The above statement is used to fetch the next row 
	if a row exists by using the defined open cursor.

Syntax to close the cursor :
--------------------------------
        CLOSE <cursor_name>

By this statement we can close the previously opened cursor. 














Example:
=========
In the following example firstly we are declaring the Cursor and selecting the all record from Emp table. And after opened the cursor we fetch the record one by one from cursor. And then insert these record in Emp2 table


delimiter //

CREATE PROCEDURE DemoCurs1()
    BEGIN
    DECLARE d INT DEFAULT 0;
    DECLARE id,sal INT;
    DECLARE name,city,desig VARCHAR(20);

    DECLARE cur CURSOR FOR SELECT * FROM Emp;

    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE '02000' SET d=1;
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE '23000' SET d=1;
    
    OPEN cur;
    lbl: LOOP
    IF d=1 THEN
    LEAVE lbl;
    END IF;

    IF NOT d=1 THEN
    FETCH cur INTO id,name,city,desig,sal;
    INSERT INTO Emp2 VALUES(id,name,city,desig,sal);
    END IF;
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE cur;
    END;
    //





--------
delimiter ;

CALL DemoCurs1();



now
---
	SELECT * FROM Emp2;













Triggers 
===========

A Trigger is a named database object which 
defines some action that the database should take when 
some databases related event occurs. 






Triggers are executed when you issues a data manipulation command 
like INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE on a table for which the trigger has been created. 



They are automatically executed and also transparent to the user. 
	 --------------


But for creating the trigger the user must have the CREATE TRIGGER privilege. 






The general syntax of CREATE TRIGGER is :
=======================================
        CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name trigger_time trigger_event ON tbl_name FOR EACH ROW 	trigger_statement



	trigger_name
	-----------
		name of the trigger 
		trigger can only be created on permanent table


	trigger_time 
	------------

		Trigger_time means trigger action time. 
		It can be BEFORE or AFTER

	Trigger_event
	------------
		 specifies the statement that executes the trigger. 

		The trigger_event can be any of the DML Statement :

			 INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.




	Note:
	We can not have the two trigger for a given table, 
	which have the same trigger action time and event. 

	For Instance : we cannot have two BEFORE INSERT triggers 
	for same table. But we can have a BEFORE INSERT and BEFORE UPDATE 
	trigger for a same table.









	Trigger_statement have 
	----------------------
		the statement that executes when the trigger fires but 
	if you want to execute multiple statement the you have to use the 
	BEGIN------END compound statement.



	We can refer the columns of the table that associated with trigger 
	by using the OLD and NEW keyword. 
	-----------------------------------


	OLD.column_name is used to refer the column of an existing row before 
	it is deleted or updated and NEW.column_name is used to 
	refer the column of a new row that is inserted or after updated existing row.

	In INSERT trigger we can use only NEW.column_name because there is no old row 
	and in a DELETE trigger we can use only OLD.column_name because there is no new row. 



	But in UPDATE trigger we can use both, OLD.column_name is 
	used to refer the columns of a row before it is updated and NEW.Column_name 
	is used to refer the column of the row after it is updated. 



Example:
	Write a trigger for updating the Salary column of Employee table before 
	inserting any record in Emp table. 





delimiter //
	CREATE TRIGGER bi_trig_emp BEFORE INSERT ON Emp
	FOR EACH ROW

	BEGIN
	UPDATE Employee SET Salary=Salary-300 WHERE salary>5000;
	END;
//




delimiter ;

and now inset an record in emp table and see the effect................


Example:
write an trigger to modifying the salary of Employee 
table before updating the record of the same table




	


delimiter //
CREATE TRIGGER updtrigger BEFORE UPDATE ON Employee
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
IF NEW.Salary<=500 THEN
SET NEW.Salary=10000;
ELSEIF NEW.Salary>500 THEN
SET NEW.Salary=15000;
END IF;
END
//




===================================================
MySQL Transactional 
===================================================
MySQL5.0 supports local transactions by statements 
like START TRANSACTION, SET AUTOCOMMIT, COMMIT and ROLLBACK. 



Transaction means a group of SQL Statements, which executes as a unit








step 1:
open sql config-->remove instance

step 2:
uninstall mysql

step 3:
go to mysql installation directory delete it

go to program file in C dir 
hidden folders  
organize in menu bar->select folder option-->
view-->show hidden files

c-->program data open it and delete mysql folder

then try to install mysql
